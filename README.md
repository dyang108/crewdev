4. **Code Review** ‚Üí Staff Engineer reviews all implementations
5. **Integration** ‚Üí Product Manager ensures end-to-end functionality

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Capabilities

Your software engineering team now has access to powerful tools for local development:

### üìÅ File System Tools
- **Read/Write Files**: Create and modify code files locally
- **Directory Management**: Create project structures and organize code
- **File Operations**: List, check existence, and delete files

### ‚ö° Execution & Server Management
- **Command Execution**: Run shell commands and scripts
- **Server Management**: Start, stop, and monitor development servers
- **Port Management**: Check port availability and avoid conflicts
- **Package Installation**: Install Python and Node.js dependencies

### üèóÔ∏è Development Environment Tools
- **Project Creation**: Set up Python, Node.js, and React projects
- **Dependency Management**: Generate requirements.txt and package.json
- **Containerization**: Create Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml
- **Git Configuration**: Generate appropriate .gitignore files

### üéØ Role-Specific Tools
Each team member has access to tools relevant to their role:
- **Staff Engineer**: Architecture and project setup tools
- **Frontend Engineer**: React/Node.js development tools
- **Backend Engineer**: Python/API development tools
- **DevOps Engineer**: Infrastructure and deployment tools
- **Technical Skeptic**: Code review and testing tools
- **Product Manager**: Documentation and project management tools

For detailed tool documentation, see [TOOLS_GUIDE.md](TOOLS_GUIDE.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install Ollama and pull the gpt-oss:20b model:
```bash
ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
```

2. Install project dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

3. Test the tools (optional):
```bash
python test_tools.py
```

### Running the Team

```bash
# Run the complete software engineering workflow
python -m src.crewdev.main

# Run with tools example (creates a complete application)
python example_with_tools.py

# Show tool capabilities
python example_with_tools.py tools

# Train the team (for optimization)
python -m src.crewdev.main train <iterations> <filename>

# Test the team performance
python -m src.crewdev.main test <iterations> <eval_llm>
```

### Configuration

The team is configured through YAML files:

- `src/crewdev/config/agents.yaml` - Agent definitions and personalities
- `src/crewdev/config/tasks.yaml` - Task descriptions and workflows

### Customization

To work on different projects, modify the inputs in `src/crewdev/main.py`:

```python
inputs = {
    'project_name': 'Your Project Name',
    'current_year': str(datetime.now().year)
}
```

## Output

The team produces comprehensive deliverables including:
- Market research reports
- Technical architecture documents
- Frontend and backend implementations
- DevOps infrastructure setup
- Code review reports
- Integration and testing results

All outputs are saved to `project_deliverables.md` for easy review.

## Benefits

- **Diverse Perspectives**: Multiple junior engineers bring different viewpoints
- **Technical Leadership**: Staff engineer ensures quality and consistency
- **Market Focus**: Product manager ensures business value
- **Complete Workflow**: From research to deployment
- **Local Operation**: Privacy and cost benefits of local LLM

## Contributing
